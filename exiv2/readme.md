# Precompiled exiv2 binaries

Version: 0.28.3

The files in here are precompil√∂ed binaries (for Linux) for the exiv2 tool.
Source: https://github.com/exiv2/exiv2

I included a copy of this to make running it a bit easier and also their current Linx builds doesn't seem to work properly. (needed to rename a .so file to get it to work)
